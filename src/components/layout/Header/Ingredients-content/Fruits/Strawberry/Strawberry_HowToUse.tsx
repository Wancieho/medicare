                                    There are a multitude of brilliant bakes that showcase the strawberry.
                                    If you want to make a truly stunning centrepiece, have a go at this
                                    step-by-step polka-dot strawberry cake or stack the berries high in
                                    Paul Hollywood's layered sponge. For an easier bake, the cream tea
                                    cake is a supersize scone. Top with lashings of cream,
                                    strawberries and jam.

                                    Perk up your morning with a strawberry-packed smoothie. This banana
                                    & almond version is full of calcium, or try an avocado & strawberry
                                    breakfast blend - it is low in calories and has earnt our 'good for you'
                                    stamp of approval. Blend to your desired consistency and experiment

                                    Strawberries make great additions to savoury salads. This salmon,
                                    strawberry & fennel salad might sound unusual, but the peppery rocket,
                                    subtle salmon and sweet fruit work well together. Serve with fresh
                                    crusty rolls as a starter or light lunch.

                                    If you've got a glut of fruit from your allotment, or tubs of strawberries
                                    going spare, make a firm family favourite. Strawberry & rhubarb crumble is
                                    a brilliant way to use up an abundance of berries. Top with a dollop of
                                    vanilla ice cream.

                                    Trifle isn't just for Christmas, not with our summery twists. Whether it's
                                    strawberry & elderflower trifle with ginger jelly and hunks of lemon
                                    drizzle or this glorious Eton mess trifle with Sherry-steeped strawberries, you'll find the combination of custard, sponge and summer fruits hard to resist.

                                    Who could resist these strawberry & cream roly-poly biscuits for an
                                    afternoon tea treat? Freeze-dried berries make them extra special. If
                                    you want a brighter pink swirl, use a splash of food colouring to enhance
                                    their rosy hue.
