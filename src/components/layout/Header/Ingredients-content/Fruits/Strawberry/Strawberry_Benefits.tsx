                            Eating strawberries is associated with a reduced risk of many
                            chronic diseases. Strawberries may improve heart health, lower

                                    Heart disease is the most common cause of death worldwide.
                                    Studies have found a relationship between berries or berry
                                    anthocyanins and improved heart health. Large observational
                                    studies in thousands of people link berry consumption
                                    to a lower risk of heart-related deaths.

                                    risk factors for heart disease, berries may improve HDL(good)

                                <p>
                                    When carbs are digested, your body breaks them down into simple sugars
                                    and releases them into your bloodstream. Your body then starts s
                                    ecreting insulin, which tells your cells to pick up the sugar
                                    from your bloodstream and use it for fuel or storage. Imbalances
                                    in blood sugar regulation and high-sugar diets are associated with an
                                    increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Strawberries seem to slow down glucose digestion and reduce spikes in both
                                    glucose and insulin following a carb-rich meal, compared to a carb-rich
                                    meal without strawberries.
                                    Thus, strawberries may be particularly useful for preventing metabolic
                                    syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

                                <p>
                                    Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal
                                    cells. Cancer formation and progression is often linked to oxidative
                                    stress and chronic inflammation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A number of studies suggest that berries may help prevent several types
                                    of cancer through their ability to fight oxidative stress and inflammation .
                                    Strawberries have been shown to inhibit tumor formation in animals with
                                    mouth cancer and in human liver cancer cells.

                                    The protective effects of strawberries may be driven by ellagic acid
                                    and ellagitannins, which have been shown to stop the growth of cancer
                                    cells. More human research is needed to improve the understanding of the effects
                                    of strawberries on cancer before any solid conclusions can be reached.
