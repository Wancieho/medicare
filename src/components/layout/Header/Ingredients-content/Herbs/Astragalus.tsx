                    <p>
                        The scientific name of Astragalus root is Astragalus membranaceus. It is a
                        type of flowering plant which is celebrated throughout centuries. It is an
                        essential part of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, it is an
                        adaptogen. Adaptogens are natural substances with the potential of stimulating
                        the body's immunity. They work in response to physical, environmental,
                        and emotional stressors. They strengthen your immune system and have the
                        capacity to reduce swelling. Astragalus is said to relieve the symptoms of
                        hay fever, diabetes, and other conditions that might threaten your well-being.
                        However, there is still a lack of scientific evidence to prove these. that are

                                Astragalus root can treat various heart conditions as it has a diuretic effect.
                                It lowers blood pressure and relaxes the blood vessels. Hence, your heart can
                                pump a more significant amount of blood.

                                As per a study, astragalus root curbs the stress level. It also brings a
                                sense of peace and calms your mind and body. People who suffer from frequent
                                mood swings and constant nervousness may benefit from consuming astragalus root.
                                Thus, it can be instrumental for your mental health. A significant benefit that
                                distinguishes the astragalus herb from other traditional medicines is that it
                                is an adaptogen. This quality makes it non-toxic and safe. It tweaks your hormone
                                production capacity and physical reaction against internal and external stressors.

                                Diet, lifestyle, and the environment negatively affect the estrogen levels in the

                                in them positively affect health and longevity. In addition, one can combine
                                with chemotherapy to increase the chances of survival. Hence, it enhances your

                                According to research, astragalus root removes seasonal allergies by reducing
                                the severity of reactions. It also dramatically improves the quality of life.
                                It works by regulating the immune system and reducing sensitivity to allergens.
                                Hence, if you are frequently affected by seasonal allergies, taking astragalus
                                root extract by mouth daily can be beneficial. Consuming it for 3-6 weeks may
                                reduce running nose, itching, and sneezing.

                        doses of up to 60 grams daily have been safely used for up to 4 months.

                    Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if astragalus is safe to
                    use when pregnant or breast-feeding. But some research in animals suggests
                    that it can be toxic during pregnancy and to the fetus. Stay on the safe side
                    and avoid use.

                <p>
                    Auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus
                    erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other immune system conditions:
                    Astragalus might make the immune system more active. This could worsen the symptoms
                    of auto-immune diseases. Avoid using astragalus if you have any of these conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are some cases when Astragalus root will not benefit you. However, it
                    is safe to use astragalus orally and appropriately. The adequate dosage is 60
                    grams for approximately four months. Symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rashes</li>

                    The below side effects of chemotherapy can be reduced by
                    giving astragalus intravenously (by IV) or using Chinese herbal

                    It's important to note that these are uncommon. Some astragalus species
                    are toxic to livestock. These are usually not present in dietary supplements.
                    Several species have a neurotoxin. They are known as swainsonine, which

                    There is a lack of evidence in astragalus use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
                    The repercussions might be toxic to the mother and fetus. Hence, it would help

                    healthcare professional to avoid complications.

                <h2>Interaction with other Drugs:</h2>
                <p>
                    Astragalus may react with other medications that you might be taking. In such a
                    case, it suppresses your immune system. Here are some medicines that might
                    interact with astragalus and elevate your problems.
                </p>
                <h3>Cyclophosphamide</h3>
                <p>
                    Cyclophosphamide reduces the immune response. Astragalus, on the other hand,
                    increases its functioning. Thus, it might disrupt its positive effects if you
                    consume it with astragalus.
                </p>
                <h3>Immunosuppressant</h3>
                <p>
                    Immunosuppressant is similar to cyclophosphamide. However, it also decreases
                    the activity of the immune system. Thus it is not advisable to combine both.
                    In addition, medications after a transplant can worsen your condition.

                <h3>Lithium</h3>
                <p>
                    Astragalus slows down the ability of the body to get rid of lithium. As a
                    result, it elevates lithium levels in the body and causes severe side effects.
                    It would help if you talked to your doctor or physician before changing the
                    combination to your body's requirements.

                    <p>
                        Growing Astragalus from seed is more difficult than other herbs. The
                        seeds require a minimum three week cold stratification period. To
                        further aid germination, soak the seeds in water or scarify the seed
                        coat with fine grade sandpaper before sowing. Seeds can take as long
                        as nine weeks to sprout.  Astragalus herb plants can be directly
                        seeded in the garden, but the general recommendation is to give them
                        a head start by sowing indoors during late winter.

                    Harvesting Astragalus Root The roots are the medicinal
                    part of Astragalus herb plants. While it can take anywhere from two
                    to four years for the taproot to grow to a usable size, roots of any
                    age can be harvested. Older roots are considered more potent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harvest Astragalus in the fall by first removing the foliage and stems.
                    The Astragalus herb plants have no medicinal value and can be composted
                    or discarded. Next, carefully dig around the base of the stem to expose
                    the taproot. Continue digging and twisting until the majority of the root
                    can be extracted from the ground.
