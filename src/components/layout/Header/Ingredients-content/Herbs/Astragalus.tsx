                    <p className="paragraph-content">
                        Astragalus membranaceus/mongholicus is a kind of flowering plant
                        which is a root that has been used for centuries in traditional
                        chinese medicine.It is also an adaptogen which is a class of natural
                        substances that are believed to stimulate the body's resistance to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Physical</li>

                        </ol>
                        The chemicals in astragalus also seem
                        to stimulate the immune system and reduce swelling.
                        Astragalus is commonly used to treat:
                        <ul>
                            <li>hay fever</li>

                    The specific plant compounds in astragalus, such as polysaccharides (APS),
                    saponins, flavonoids, and alkaloids, produce most of its health benefits.
                    Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has been proven responsible for most of
                    the herb's benefits.

                <h3>#1 Astragalus May Support Immunity</h3>
                As previously mentioned, astragalus is used extensively as an immune-boosting
                herb in traditional chinese medicine. Medical science has investigated
                astragalus to understand its success in traditional chinese medicine on immune health.

                They've discovered the plant compound, astragalus polysaccharides (APS), benefits
                the immune function by:
                <ul>

                    <li>Supporting all immune system organs, cells, and bacteria</li>
                    <li>Promoting the proliferation of immune cells</li>
                    <li>Stimulating the release of cytokines—small, secreted proteins
                        from cells that play a role in immune modulation and communication
                        between cells.</li>
                    <li>Supporting the secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig)-An immune
                        antibody that plays a role in fighting infections.</li>
                    <li>Affecting the transmission of immune signals.</li>
                    <li>Supporting repair of the immune system.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In other words, astragalus provides a broad and complete range of
                    immune support, which explains why it's been so successful in
                    traditional Chinese medicine. Gaia Herbs offers astragalus as a
                    stand-alone tincture or in our everyday immune mushrooms &
                    herbs and Astragalus supreme herbal blends.

                <h2>#2 Astragalus May Help Promote a Healthy Heart</h2>
                <p>
                    After decades of research, new treatments, and public education campaigns,
                    heart disease remains the number-one killer of American men and women
                    (with cancer close behind).
                    Fortunately, there is a lot you can do in the lifestyle department to
                    reduce your risk, including managing stress, exercising regularly, quitting
                    smoking, limiting alcohol, and eating a healthy plant-based diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Herbal supplements, like astragalus, Hawthorne, and turmeric have a history
                    of traditional use in supporting the heart and cardiovascular system.
                    APS (astragalus polysaccharide) has been shown to have numerous properties
                    that may benefit the heart, including its antioxidant, anti-aging,
                    immune-supportive, and blood sugar- and blood-lipid balancing actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the flavonoids in astragalus may provide additional antioxidant
                    benefits. Talk to your healthcare provider if you're considering taking
                    astragalus to support your heart. It may interact with certain medications.
                </p>

                <h2>#3 Astragalus Can Support the Liver</h2>

                <p> Astragalus is used extensively in traditional chinese medicine to support the
                    liver. There is some scientific evidence to validate this traditional use.
                </p>
                <p> A 2021 animal study published in the journal Foods found
                    astragalus saponins and Astragalus polysaccharide supported healthy hepatic
                    function, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and gut flora disorders
                    in mice as a result of alcohol. It also could ameliorate lipid accumulation
                    in the serum and liver. Lipid accumulation occurs in pre-fatty or fatty liver
                    disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Astragalus polysaccharide has also been shown to provide a protective effect
                    on the livers of mice undergoing chemotherapy. Although more research is needed
                    in humans, these studies suggest taking astragalus for liver complaints may be
                    beneficial.
                </p>

                <h3>#4: Astragalus May Benefit Sugar Metabolism</h3>

                <p>
                    Blood sugar imbalances of various kinds are on the rise in the Western world.
                    For example, per the National Institutes of Health:
                    An estimated 34.2 million people have diabetes (10.5 percent of the U.S.
                    population). An estimated 88 million adults ages 18 years or older (34.5 percent
                    of U.S. adults) have prediabetes. 1 in 3 adults has metabolic syndrome, also
                    known as insulin resistance, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes.
                    Fortunately, more people are becoming aware of the role lifestyle can play in
                    blood sugar balance and metabolic health, specifically eating a whole-foods diet,
                    exercising regularly, managing stress, and getting enough sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Herbs like astragalus can also play a role in supporting metabolic health and
                    sugar metabolism. A 2020 review published in
                    <span className="span-em">Frontiers of Pharmacology</span> showed that
                    astragalus polysaccharide promotes healthy blood sugar by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supporting normal levels of blood glucose*</li>
                        <li>Increasing the insulin sensitivity*</li>
                        <li>Improving insulin resistance (IR)*</li>
                        <li>And inhibiting the apoptosis of islet β cells (pancreatic cells that play
                            a role in insulin production and blood sugar regulation).
                        </li>
                    </ul>We also know astragalus supports the liver, which stores and releases
                    glucose based on the body's needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stress can also cause blood sugar imbalance by recruiting the release of glucose
                    for energy or fight-or-flight and stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol.
                    This phenomenon causes a drop in insulin, which can be problematic if you're
                    already dealing with blood sugar concerns. As an adaptogen, astragalus helps
                    balance that stress response, which may further explain its benefits on
                    sugar metabolism. If you have an existing health issue and are interested in
                    trying astragalus for metabolic health or sugar metabolism, check with your
                    practitioner regarding the appropriate dose and medication interactions.
                    If you'd like to try astragalus for overall metabolic health and do not have
                    a pre-existing issue, check out
                    <span className="span-em">Gaia's Astragalus tinctures, capsules, or Everyday

                <h3>#5 Astragalus May Provide Kidney Support</h3>

                <p>
                    The kidneys are one of the body's most essential and under-appreciated
                    detoxification organs.
                    They are also a source of concern for millions of Americans who suffer
                    from kidney health concerns, which are often rooted in heart disease,
                    high blood pressure, infection, injury, and blood sugar issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enormous focus is placed on kidney health in traditional Chinese medicine,
                    with some systems believing they are more important than the heart.
                    This is why it's not uncommon for kidney-specific herbs, like astragalus,
                    to be included in TCM herbal formulas.
                </p>
                <p>There is scientific evidence to support the use of astragalus in this
                    traditional and proactive approach. One study published in Analytical
                    Cellular Pathology found APS had a protective effect on the kidneys
                    in the presence of sepsis.
                </p>
                <p>It worked by helping regulate inflammation, apoptosis (programmed cell
                    death), endoplasmic reticulum stress (a type of stress that plays
                    a role in disease progression), and normal cell function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another animal study entitled Astragalus Polysaccharide Attenuates
                    Cisplatin-Induced Acute Kidney Injury by Suppressing Oxidative Damage
                    and Mitochondrial Dysfunction found that APS pretreatment might prevent
                    pharmaceutical-induced kidney injury.
                </p>
                <p>Researchers believe it works by protecting against oxidative damage,
                    protecting mitochondria (the powerhouses of the cells), and stopping
                    mitochondrial-mediated cell death caused by the chemotherapy drug, Cisplatin.
                    In other traditional healing systems, such as Ayurveda, the kidneys are considered
                    closely connected to the liver.
                </p>
                <p>This fact could also explain some of astragalus's actions on kidney health via its
                    previously mentioned liver-supportive benefits. More in-depth research is needed
                    to reach a definitive conclusion.
                    However, based on these studies, and its long and successful traditional use,
                    there is cause to believe astragalus is good for kidney health.
                </p>

                <h3>#6: Astragalus May Support A Healthy Inflammation Response</h3>

                <p>
                    As we've discussed in previous points, astragalus contains antioxidant compounds,
                    such as polyphenols, that protect against the oxidative damage of free radicals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those unfamiliar with this topic, free radicals are unstable molecules
                    that can cause oxidative damage to cells resulting in inflammation, aging, and
                    disease unless they are kept in check by antioxidants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Antioxidants, such as those made by the body or found in astragalus, fruits, and
                    vegetables act as natural predators to free radicals, destroying them and helping
                    maintain inflammatory balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A study entitled: <span className="span-em">Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory
                        effects of total flavonoids of Astragalus by regulating NF-KB and MAPK signaling
                        pathways in RAW 264.7 macrophages</span> showed that the flavonoids in Astragalus
                    had in vivo and in vitro immuno-modulatory effects (meaning they supported
                    optimal immune system function) and supported normal inflammatory response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In vivo and in vitro refer to how different scientific studies are conducted.
                    <span className="span-em">In vivo</span> means the research was done on a
                    live subject. <span className="span-em">In vitro</span> means the research
                    was done in a laboratory dish or test tube.
                </p>
                <p>However, the researchers noted they did not know the exact mechanisms behind
                    its actions. The bottom line is that antioxidant-rich plants, like astragalus,
                    turmeric, and green tea, can be a beneficial way to help keep free radicals
                    in check.
                </p>

                <h3>#7: Astragalus May Speed Wound Healing When Applied Topically</h3>

                <small> NOTE: Herbs aren't just outstanding for taking internally, but, many have a
                    rich history of use as salves, balms, and other applications.
                </small>
                <p>
                    Astragalus is one of those versatile herbs that can be used topically or
                    internally. In traditional Chinese medicine, astragalus is renowned for
                    its ability to speed wound healing when applied as a paste or poultice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research has found that astragalus polysaccharide is responsible for
                    these benefits. A study entitled “Wound healing effect of an Astragalus membranaceus
                    polysaccharide and its mechanism” found astragalus possessed high potential in wound
                    healing. Its mechanism was associated with inhibiting inflammation, accelerating
                    the cell cycle, and promoting the secretion of repair factors.

                    Additional research published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology has validated its
                    wound-healing and scar-reducing properties.
                    There is also evidence the saponins in astragalus may play a role in wound healing.

                        Diabetes. Early research suggests that astragalus, given intravenously
                        (by IV) or taken by mouth as a combination product, might help control
                        blood sugar and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

                <h3>What are the side affects of using Astragalus and what is it's dosage?</h3>
                <p>
                    Taken orally: Astragalus is possibly safe for most adult, however,
                    doses of up to 60 grams daily have been safely used for up to 4 months.
                    Astragalus is usually well-tolerated.

                <h4>Precausions:</h4>
                <p>
                    feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if astragalus is safe to
                    use when pregnant or breast-feeding. But some research in animals suggests
                    that it can be toxic during pregnancy and to the fetus. Stay on the safe side
                    and avoid use.
