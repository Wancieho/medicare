                    <h2>What is Lemon-Balm?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is a perennial herbaceous plant in the
                        mint family Lamiaceae, and native to south-central Europe, the Mediterranean
                        Basin, Iran, and Central Asia, but now also naturalized in the America
                        and elsewhere. Lemon balm plants grow bushy and upright to a maximum height
                        of 100 cm (39 in). The heart-shaped leaves are 2-8 centimetres (0.79-3.15 inch)
                        long, and have a rough, veined surface. They are soft and hairy with scalloped
                        edges, and have a mild lemon scent. During summer, small white or pale pink
                        flowers appear. The plants live for ten years; the crop plant is replaced
                        after five years to allow the ground to rejuvenate.

                <h2>The Benefits of using Lemon-Balm in detail:</h2>
                <h3>#1 Relieve stress</h3>
                <p>
                    Lemon balm is said to soothe symptoms of stress, help you to relax,
                    and boost your mood.</p>
                <p>
                    A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15272110/"
                        target="_blank">2004 study</a> found that taking lemon balm eased the
                    negative mood effects of laboratory-induced psychological stress.
                    Participants who took lemon balm self-reported an increased sense of
                    calmness and reduced feelings of alertness. Although this was a
                    double-blind, placebo-controlled study, it had a small sample size of eighteen
                    people. Further research is needed to elaborate on these findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use Take 300 milligrams (mg) of lemon balm in capsule form
                    twice a day. You can take a single dose of 600 mg in acute episodes of
                    stress.
                </p>
                <h3>#2 Reduce anxiety</h3>
                <p>
                    Lemon balm may also be used to help reduce symptoms of anxiety, such as
                    nervousness and excitability. Research published in 2014 examined the mood
                    and cognitive effects of foods containing lemon balm. The supplement was
                    mixed into a beverage and into yogurt along with either natural or artificial
                    sweeteners. Participants in both groups reported positive effects on various
                    aspects of mood, including reduced levels of anxiety. Although this is promising,
                    more research is needed to truly determine its efficacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Take 300 to 600 mg of lemon balm three times per day. You can take
                    a higher dose in acute episodes of anxiety.
                </p>
                <h3>#3 Boost cognitive function</h3>
                <p>
                    The same 2014 study also looked at the effects of lemon balm in improving
                    cognitive function. Participants were asked to do cognitive tasks involving
                    memory, mathematics, and concentration. The results of these computerized
                    tasks suggest that participants who ingested lemon balm performed better than
                    those who did not. Although these participants did experience an increase
                    in levels of alertness and performance, it is still possible for fatigue to
                    set in over time. Combining lemon balm with food also affects its absorption
                    rate, which may have had an impact on its efficacy, however, additional research
                    is needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Take 300 to 600 mg of lemon balm three times a day.
                </p>
                <h3>#4 Ease Insomnia and other sleep disorders</h3>
                <p>
                    Combining lemon balm with valerian may help relieve restlessness and sleep disorders
                    such as insomnia. Researchers in one 2006 study found that children who took a
                    combined dose experienced a 70 to 80 percent improvement in symptoms. Both the
                    researchers and parents regarded lemon balm as being a good or very good treatment.
                    Still, more research is needed to validate these findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Drink a cup of tea brewed with valerian and lemon balm before bed.
                    You can find loose-leaf or bagged options at your local grocery store or online.
                </p>
                <h3>#5 Treat cold sores</h3>
                <p>
                    You can even apply lemon balm topically at the first sign of a cold sore.
                    Participants in a 1999 study applied either a lemon balm or placebo cream on the
                    affected area four times per day for five days. The researchers found that the
                    participants who used the lemon balm cream experienced fewer symptoms and healed
                    faster than those who did not. The researchers also suggested that using lemon balm
                    cream may help prolong the intervals between cold sore outbreaks. Further studies are
                    needed to expand on these findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Apply a lemon balm cream to the affected area several times per day. Be
                    sure to patch test the cream on the inside of your forearm before applying it to the
                    cold sore. If you do not experience any irritation or inflammation within 24 hours,
                    it should be safe to use.
                </p>
                <h3>#6 Relieve Indigestion</h3>
                <p>If you experience frequent abdominal pain and discomfort, lemon balm may have a positive
                    effect on your digestion. A small <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20385075/"
                        target="_blank">study from 2010</a> assessed the effects of a cold dessert
                    containing lemon balm on functional dyspepsia. Participants ate a sorbet, with
                    or without the herb, after a meal. Although both types of desserts lessened the
                    symptoms and their intensity, the dessert containing lemon balm intensified this
                    effect. More research is needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Add 1 teaspoon (tsp) of lemon balm powder to a bowl of ice cream or
                    smoothie and enjoy.
                </p>
                <h3>#7 Treat Nuasea</h3>
                <p>Given its potential impact on your digestive system, lemon balm may also help relieve
                    feelings of nausea. A 2005 review assessing the results of several studies on lemon
                    balm found the herb to be useful in treating gastrointestinal symptoms such as this.
                    Although this is a promising development, it is important to recognize the study
                    limitations. Many of the studies looked at lemon balm used in conjunction with other
                    herbs. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of lemon balm when used alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Drink a cup of lemon balm tea at the first sign of nausea. You can find
                    loose-leaf or bagged options at your local grocery store or online.
                </p>
                <h3>#8 Minimize menstrual cramps</h3>
                <p>There is also research to suggest that lemon balm can be used to relieve menstrual
                    cramps and premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
                    A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4557408/" target="_blank">
                        2015 study</a> researched the effect of lemon balm in reducing the intensity of
                    cramps in 100 high school girls. The girls took either a lemon balm essence or
                    a placebo for three consecutive menstrual cycles. The intensity of PMS symptoms
                    was analyzed before and one, two, and three months after the trial. The group who
                    took the lemon balm reported a significant reduction in symptoms. Further research
                    is needed to confirm these findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Take 1200 mg of lemon balm daily for optimal results. This will allow
                    the herb to get into your system long before it is time for PMS symptoms to appear.
                    Continued use is thought to reduce your symptoms over time.
                </p>
                <h3>#9 Ease headache pain</h3>
                <p>Lemon balm may also be useful in treating headaches, especially if they are happening
                    as a result of stress. Its relaxing properties can help you to unwind, release tension,
                    and relax your muscles. It's also though that ingesting the herb can help to open up
                    and relax tight blood vessels, which can contribute to headaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: If you experience recurrent headaches, you may find it beneficial take 300 to
                    600 mg of lemon balm up to three times per day. This will allow the herb to get into your
                    system well before a headache develops. You can take a higher dose if you feel a headache
                    developing.
                </p>
                <h3>#10 Lessen toothache pain</h3>
                <p>
                    Lemon balm's pain-relieving properties may make it an ideal choice for relieving toothache
                    pain. In addition to drawing on its relaxing properties, this home remedy is thought to
                    target inflammation in the body. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use: Use a cotton swab to apply lemon balm oil to the affected area as needed. Be
                    sure to select an oil that has already been diluted by a carrier oil, such as jojoba. If
                    you purchase pure lemon balm oil, you should dilute it. Essential oils should not be applied
                    directly to the skin until they are diluted in a carrier oil.

                    <p>
                        You may be able to minimize side effects, such as stomach upset, by ingesting
                        lemon balm alongside food. You can also reduce your risk for side effects
                        by consuming fewer than 2 grams of lemon balm per day.Lemon balm should only
                        be used for a short period of time. A general rule of thumb is to take one week
                        off after every three weeks of use. You should not take lemon balm for longer
                        than four months at a time without a break.

                    <h2>How do I grow Lemon-Balm?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lemon balm seeds require light and a minimum temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) to
                        germinate. The plant grows in clumps and spreads vegetatively (a new plant can
                        grow from a fragment of the parent plant), as well as by seed. In mild temperate
                        zones, the plant stems die off at the start of the winter, but shoot up again
                        in spring. Lemon balm grows vigorously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From March to May every year the seeds are sowed and planted from April to June,
                        then harvested from July to September.

                                Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is easy to grow from seed in spring,
                                but named varieties are only available as ready-grown plants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sow seeds indoors from March to May, scattering a few seeds into a small pot
                                or tray of seed compost. Cover with a thin layer of perlite, vermiculite or
                                finely sieved compost, then water gently. Place the pot in a heated
                                propagator or cover with a clear plastic bag and place in a warm spot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As soon as seedlings appear, which can take up to three weeks, take the pot out of
                                the propagator or remove the cover. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots
                                when they are large enough to handle.

                                Traditional lemon balm is a vigorous plant that eventually makes a large leafy
                                clump, and sends up flower stems that can reach 80cm (32in) tall. There are several
                                cultivars too, with variegated leaves or a more compact form. The flowers are a
                                magnet for bees.

                                        <h4>Watering</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Keep plants well watered during dry spells in summer, and cut back after flowering
                                            to encourage a fresh flush of leaves.
                                        </p>
                                    </dt>

                                        <h4>Cutting back:</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Lemon balm will self-seed readily, so if you do not want more plants, remember
                                            to remove the faded flowers before they set seed. With variegated cultivars, cut back in early summer to encourage fresh, strongly
                                            coloured shoots.

                                            Lemon balm is a long-lived plant than can form a congested clump - so lift and divide
                                            every few years in autumn to rejuvenate plants.

                                            Protect plants in pots from excessive winter wet by moving them into a sheltered
                                            position and raising up on pot feet to allow excess rainfall to drain away easily.

                                Pick fresh leaves as required throughout summer. Leaves for drying are best harvested
