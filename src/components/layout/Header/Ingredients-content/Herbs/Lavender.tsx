                    <h2>What is Lavandula(Lavender)?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lavandula(Lavender) is a genus of fourty-seven known species of flowering
                        plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Old World and is
                        found in Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, and from Europe across to
                        northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to India.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates
                        as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary
                        herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils. Lavender
                        is used in: baking traditional medicine and as an ingredient in cosmetics.

                <h3>Plant and leaves:</h3>
                <p>
                    The genus includes annual or short-lived herbaceous perennial plants, and shrub-like
                    perennials, subshrubs or small shrubs. Leaf shape is diverse across the genus. They
                    are simple in some commonly cultivated species; in other species, they are pinnately
                    toothed, or pinnate, sometimes multiple pinnate and dissected. In most species, the
                    leaves are covered in fine hairs or indumentum, which normally contain essential oils.
                </p>
                <h3>Flowers:</h3>
                <p>
                    Flowers are contained in whorls, held on spikes rising above the foliage, the spikes
                    being branched in some species. Some species produce colored bracts at the tips of
                    the inflorescences. The flowers may be blue, violet, or lilac in the wild species,
                    occasionally blackish purple or yellowish. The Sepal calyx is tubular. The corolla is
                    also tubular, usually with five lobes (the upper lip often cleft, and the lower lip
                    has two clefts).

                <h3>Baking, Cooking, and Desserts:</h3>
                <p>
                    The ancient Egyptians used this flowering herb, a member of the mint family,
                    for its potent fragrance during mummification; in ancient Greece it was
                    incorporated in treatments for everything from insomnia to backaches; and
                    it was employed so often by the Romans for healing baths that the word
                    lavender comes from the Latin verb <span className="span-em">lavare</span>
                    meaning <span className="span-em">"to wash"</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lavadula is used in the baking industry, for most of the cooking applications,
                    the dried buds, which are also referred to as flowers, are used. Lavender
                    greens have a more subtle flavor when compared to rosemary. The
                    <span className="span-em">potency</span> of
                    the lavender flowers increases with drying which necessitates more sparing
                    use to avoid a heavy, soapy aftertaste. Chefs reduce the dry amount in
                    recipes that call for fresh lavender buds by two-thirds.
                </p>
                <p>But what kind of Lavender do we need in the kitchen?
                    <span className="span-em">Culinary Lavender</span> On the other hand is a
                    term which is generally used to describe any plant of the genus Lavandula that
                    encompasses fourty-seven known species of flowers. Not all Lavenders should be
                    used for cooking, although most lavender types typically are safe to eat, culinary
                    lavender is cultivated from Lavandula angustifolia plants (commonly
                    known as English or "true" lavender) and has a lot less oil than the aromatic
                    lavender used in perfumes or soaps.
                </p>
                <h3>How do you cook and bake with lavender?</h3>
                <p>
                    While culinary lavender has a more delicate flavor than its ornamental counterparts,
                    less is still more. Dried lavender buds are about three times as potent as fresh
                    ones, so be particularly sparing when freestyling in the kitchen or using a recipe
                    that doesn't specify fresh or dried.
                </p>
                <h2>Traditional medicine:</h2>
                <p>
                    Health benefits and uses: Lavender is an herb that is used in skin and beauty
                    products but packs a <span className="span-em">wealth of health</span> benefits
                    against fungi, wounds, and anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lavender oil is believed to have antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, which
                    can help to heal minor burns and bug bites. Research suggests that it may be useful
                    for <span className="span-em">treating</span> anxiety, insomnia, depression, and
                    restlessness. Some studies suggest that consuming lavender as a <span className="span-em">tea</span>
                    can help digestive issues such as vomiting, nausea, intestinal gas, upset stomach,
                    and abdominal swelling. In addition to helping with digestive problems, lavender is
                    used to  <span className="span-em">help</span> relieve pain from headaches, sprains,
                    toothaches, and sores. It can also be used to prevent hair loss.
                </p>
                <h3>Fungal infections:</h3>
                <p>
                    A study published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology found that lavender oil
                    could be effective in combating antifungal-resistant infections.
                    The researchers found that the oil was lethal to a range of strains that can cause
                    disease in the skin. In the study, the essential oils distilled from the Lavandula
                    genus of the lavender plant seemed to work by destroying the membranes of fungal
                    cells. The study showed that Lavandula oil is potent and demonstrates antifungal
                    activity on a wide spectrum.
                </p>
                <h3>Wound healing:</h3>
                <p>
                    A study published in the journal Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
                    compared the effects of several treatments for wound healing.
                    The researchers compared the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
                    (TENS), saline solution, povidone-iodine, and lavender oil. These were applied to
                    laboratory rats. The study authors noted that wounds closed faster in the TENS and
                    lavender oil groups than the control groups. These findings suggest that lavender
                    has an acceleratory effect on wound healing.
                </p>
                <h3>Hair loss:</h3>
                <p>
                    Lavender is possibly effective for treating alopecia areata. This is a condition in
                    which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body. Research from 1998 shows that
                    lavender can promote hair growth by up to 44 percent after 7 months of treatment.
                    In a more recent study, researchers found that applying lavender oil to the backs of
                    mice helped to promote hair growth over the course of 4 weeks.

                <h3>Anxiety disorder, related conditions and Dental health:</h3>
                <p>
                    Lavender scents have been shown to reduce anxiety before a dental appointment.
                    A review article in the International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice
                    evaluates how effective Silexan might be for patients with different anxiety
                    disorders. Silexan is a lavender-oil preparation available in 80-milligram (mg)
                    gelatine capsules. The team found that Silexan had an anxiolytic, or anxiety-reducing,
                    effect on patients with generalized or subsyndromal anxiety within 2 weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers have also found that lavender scent may help anxious dental patients.
                    The investigators measured the dental anxiety levels of 340 adult patients during
                    their wait at the dentist's waiting room for their appointment.
                    Half the patients were exposed to lavender scent, while the other half were not.
                    The team found that those exposed to lavender scent reported lower levels of anxiety
                    compared to the other patients. The calming effect of lavender was present regardless
                    of the type of scheduled dental appointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kritsidima, who conducted the study,
                    concluded: "Our findings suggest that lavender could certainly be used as an
                    effective 'on-the-spot' anxiety reduction in dentists' waiting rooms."
                    Dr. M. Kritsidima, study author, Lavender does not seem to impact anxiety about
                    future dental visits. However, it has been shown to provide a sense of calm
                    while attending a treatment.
                </p>
                <h3>Post-tonsillectomy pain in children:</h3>
                <p>
                    Lavender oil has been shown to reduce the amount of painkilling medicine required
                    after a tonsillectomy. A team of researchers at the Isfahan University of Medical
                    Sciences, Iran, carried out a study to determine whether aromatherapy with Lavandula
                    angustifolia essential oil might reduce symptoms of pain in children after the
                    removal of the tonsils. The study included 48 children aged 6 to 12 years. They were
                    randomly separated into two groups of 24 participants. One group took painkillers
                    alongside lavender, and the other took only painkillers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frequency of each child's acetaminophen use and nocturnal awakening due to pain was monitored for three
                    days after surgery. Pain intensity was also measured. Acetaminophen is also known
                    as Tylenol or paracetamol, and the group using lavender oil was shown to use
                    acetaminophens less frequently. However, there was no significant difference in how
                    often they woke up at night or their perceptions of pain intensity. Due to the small
                    sample size, more research is required to fully confirm lavender oil as an effective
                    painkiller.
                </p>
                <h3>Premenstrual emotional symptoms:</h3>
                <p>
                    Researchers have also studied whether lavender might help to alleviate premenstrual
                    emotional symptoms. Many women of reproductive age experience a range of symptoms in
                    the premenstrual phase, commonly known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Even though
                    PMS is common, no single treatment is universally recognized as effective. As a
                    result, many women turn to alternative therapies, such as aromatherapy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This crossover study involved 17 women, aged on average 20.6 years, with
                    mild-to-moderate premenstrual symptoms. The participants spent one menstrual cycle
                    with no lavender aromatherapy treatment, and another undergoing lavender aromatherapy.
                    The study concluded that lavender aromatherapy could alleviate premenstrual emotional
                    symptoms.
                </p>
                <h3>Lavender flower:</h3>
                <p>
                    Lavender, of course, begins as a plant with bright purple flowers.
                    In its original form, it has a soothing fragrance. You can add the buds to foods,
                    use them in a potpourri, or steep them in tea. You can even dry them and place
                    small sachets in your drawers to freshen your linens.
                </p>
                <h3>Essential oil:</h3>
                <p>
                    Lavender is commonly used in aromatherapy. To reap the benefits of its calming
                    smell, you can simply hold a bottle of lavender oil to your nose and inhale.
                    For a more sustained experience, you may prefer to place a few drops of the
                    oil into a diffuser, which can spread its aroma throughout a room.
                </p>
                <h3>Topical oil:</h3>
                <p>
                    Lavender oil is created by steeping lavender buds in a carrier oil, such as olive
                    or coconut oil, typically for at least 1 week. In the finished product, lavender
                    oil should account for just 0.5 percent to 2 percent of the total amount of oil,
                    or 3 to 12 drops of essential oil per ounce of carrier oil. You can apply this
                    oil topically, but it's important to talk with your doctor before using lavender
                    oil directly on skin. Unless directed to do so by a healthcare professional,
                    don't apply it on or near:
                    <div>

                            <li>
                                To choose a high quality lavender oil, look for a product tightly sealed
                                in a dark glass bottle with no additives or synthetic fragrances. And be
                                sure to give it a sniff! A quality oil should have a strong smell.

                                During early times, lavender was recommended for people suffering
                                from insomnia or other sleep disorders. People stuffed their
                                pillows with lavender flowers to help them fall asleep and get
                                a better night's rest.

                                Today, research suggests that breathing in lavender's aroma could
                                improve sleep quality. A systematic review of 15 studies from 2014
                                found that inhaling essential oils, including lavender, had positive
                                effects in people with mild sleep disturbances. Numerous smaller
                                studies have found additional benefits of lavender for sleep issues.

                                Research from 2015 showed that people who used lavender aromatherapy
                                felt more refreshed upon waking. Another 2010 studyTrusted Source
                                conducted on people with anxiety disorders revealed that orally
                                administered lavender oil helped them sleep longer at night.

                            <dt>Lavender may also provide support for people with anxiety. In a
                                large meta-analysis from 2019Trusted Source, people with anxiety
                                disorders who took 160-milligram lavender oil capsules experienced
                                significant decreases in anxiety.

                                Other studies have found similar results. One from 2015 involved 60
                                people in a coronary intensive care unit. The researchers found that
                                those treated with lavender essential oil had lower levels of anxiety
                                and better sleep.

                                Another study from 2010 compared lavender capsules to the anti-anxiety
                                medication lorazepam, concluding that lavender's effects were comparable
                                to the prescription drug.

                                Topical use of lavender oil might help to treat a disease called
                                alopecia aerata, which causes a person's hair to fall out in patches.
                            </dt>
                            <dt>According to an older 1998 study of 86 people with alopecia areata,
                                44 percent experienced improved hair growth after massaging an essential
                                oil blend of thyme, rosemary, lavender, and cedarwood in a mixture of
                                carrier oils into their scalp daily for seven months.

                            <dt>
                                While this study is promising, it's difficult to say whether the hair
                                growth could be contributed to lavender specifically.
                                An animal study from 2021 also found that lavender oil successfully
                                stimulated hair growth within a 28-day timeframe.

                                The calming effects of lavender might be enough to soothe away a
                                headache or migraine. In one study from 2016, people with migraine
                                who received 3 months of lavender therapy scored lower on a headache
                                assessment scale than a control group.

                                In another 2012 study, 47 participants with migraine inhaled lavender
                                essential oil for 15 minutes. They experienced reduced headache
                                severity and frequency.

                                According to the National Cancer InstituteTrusted Source, aromatherapy
                                can help people with cancer manage the side effects of their treatment.
                                Lavender aromatherapy may help lower anxiety about cancer treatment

                                Compared to more aggressive treatments, lavender oil could be a gentle
                                way to treat acne due to its ability to kill bacteria. In a 2013 study,
                                a combination of lavender oil and aloe extract effectively inhibited
                                the growth of one bacterial strain that causes acne.

                                Lavender has long been used as a traditional remedy for burns, and some
                                older researchTrusted Source has suggested there's scientific data to
                                confirm this use. According to a 2009 studyTrusted Source, its
                                antimicrobial activity might also help prevent infections after a
                                burn.

                                Lavender contains two inflammation-fighting compounds called
                                linalool and linalyl acetate. A 2020 study suggests that these
                                may provide relief for skin issues such as:

                                Lavender's soothing powers might extend to healing wounded skin.
                                A review of 20 studies found that lavender oil increased the rate of wound
                                healing, promoted the growth of collagen, and boosted the tissue remodeling
                                process of the skin.

                                While ingesting lavender oil on its own is not recommended, lavender-infused
                                capsules are often used in the treatment of anxiety.

                                With a color and scent as appealing as lavender's, it's not surprising that countless beauty products feature it prominently, including:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>face masks</li>
                                    <li>cleansers</li>
                                    <li>body bars</li>

                                </ul>
                                As with lotions and creams, these products may not impart much clinical benefit, but can be a pleasant part of a beauty regimen.

                    One study found that lavender fragrance could have a beneficial effect on insomnia
                    and depression in female college students. However, the authors highlighted that
                    repeated studies are needed to confirm effective proportions of lavender oil and
                    carrier oil for insomnia and depression.

                        According to the <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/lavender">
                            NCCIH</a>, it's likely safe to consume lavender in the amounts typically
                        used in foods. So go ahead and enjoy your lavender tea, muffins, or honey.

                    <p>
                        Safely using lavender as a topical oil will depend on your skin's sensitivity.
                        Some people experience an allergic reaction on the skin following the
                        application of lavender oil. Always use a carrier oil and do a patch test
                        before you use lavender on your skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More research is needed to determine the safety of lavender in people who
                        are pregnant or breastfeeding. If these conditions apply to you, talk with
                        your doctor before beginning any treatment with lavender.

                        A single to several drops of lavender essential oil (20 mg to 120 mg)
                        diluted in a base or carrier oil, or added to hot water in a diffuser or
                        humidifier, infiltrated on a cotton pad, or dripped in a jar for inhalation
                        has been described for aromatherapy. For consumption as a tea, 1 to 2 tsp
                        (5 to 10 mL) of lavender herb can be steeped in 1 cup of boiling water. A
                        proprietary oral product, Silexan, is usually dosed at 80 or 160 mg/day for
                        use in anxiety.

                    Lavender is used in many different types of products. A specific lavender oil
                    product (Silexan) has most often been used by adults in doses of 80-160 mg by
                    mouth daily for up to 10 weeks. Lavender essential oil is commonly used in
                    aromatherapy and various topical products such as massage oils and lotions.
                    Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose

                    <h2>How do I grow Lavender?</h2>
                    <p>
                        lavender thrives in most soil qualities, from poor to moderately fertile.
                        Lavender makes only one demand for the soil: It must drain well. Standing
                        water and wet areas could encourage root rot. Amend compacted or clay
                        soil with compost or aged manure to improve drainage. Plant lavender in
                        a spot with at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day, full sun.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            Lavender is best planted as a young plant starting in the spring
                            after the soil has warmed up to at least (15 degrees Celcius or
                            59 degrees Fahrenheit) and the threat of frost has passed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If planting in the fall, choose larger, more established plants to
                            ensure their survival through the winter.

                <h3>How to Plant Lavender:</h3>
                <p>
                    Lavender is challenging to grow from seed; we recommend purchasing
                    small starter plants from a garden nursery or taking a softwood
                    cutting from an existing plant. Seeds may take up to three months to
                    germinate, and seedlings must be overwintered indoors in cool climates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plant lavender 2 to 3 feet apart. Plants typically reach between 1 and
                    3 feet in height. Add mulch (rock or pea gravel work particularly
                    well) to keep weeds minimal. Keep the mulch away from the crown of the
                    lavender plant, however, to prevent excess moisture and root rot.
