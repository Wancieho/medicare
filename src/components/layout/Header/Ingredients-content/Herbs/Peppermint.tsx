                    <h2>What is Peppermint?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Peppermint is an aromatic herb in the mint family. It is a hybrid mint that's a
                        cross between spearmint and watermint. It can be found naturally in North
                        America and Europe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Peppermint typically occurs in moist habitats, which include stream sides and
                        drainage ditches. As a hybrid, peppermint is usually sterile, producing no seeds
                        and reproducing only vegetatively, spreading by its runners.

                        Outside of its native range, areas where peppermint was formerly grown for oil
                        often have an abundance of feral plants, it is considered invasive in
                        Australia, the Gal√°pagos Islands, New Zealand, and the United States in the
                        Great Lakes region, kept record of since 1843.

                    Peppermint (Mentha, piperita) is a hybrid species of mint, a cross between
                    watermint and spearmint. Native to Europe and the Middle East, and the plant is
                    now widely spread and cultivated in many regions of the world. It is occasionally
                    found in the wild with its parent species. Although the genus Mentha comprises
                    more than 25 species, the one in most common use is peppermint. While Western
                    peppermint is derived from Mentha and piperita, Chinese peppermint, or bohe,
                    is derived from the fresh leaves of M. haplocalyx. M. piperita and M. haplocalyx
                    are both recognized as plant sources of menthol and menthone, and are among
                    the oldest herbs used for both culinary and medicinal products.

                                Some research suggests that the aroma of peppermint may help reduce

                                <li>You typically use 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried peppermint leaves per
                                    8 ounces (240 ml) of hot water. Steep the leaves for about 5-10
                                    minutes, then strain and drink. You can drink peppermint tea up
                                    to 3 times a day, especially for digestive issues or relaxation.

                                    to avoid skin irritation. A common dilution ratio is 1-2 drops of
                                    peppermint oil per tablespoon of carrier oil. For massage, use the
                                    diluted oil sparingly, as the menthol in peppermint oil can have a
                                    cooling and sometimes intense sensation on the skin.

                                    per capsule. The usual recommendation is to take one capsule before

                                    provider.

                                    recipe. For dried peppermint leaves in tea, as mentioned earlier, 1
                                    to 2 teaspoons per cup of hot water is a common guideline.

                <h2>When to Plant Peppermint:</h2>
                <p>
                    Mint is a prodigious and invasive grower in many different types of climates,
                    so consider planting your peppermint inside in a container instead of your
                    herb garden. Peppermint should be planted in early spring after the last frost
                    of the winter has passed. Peppermint grows in USDA hardiness zones 5 to 9.
                    It can tolerate quick spurts of frost, but cannot survive temperatures that
                    stay cold for extended periods of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing peppermint is faster when you propagate it from cuttings rather than
                    planting from mint seeds. Follow these steps to plant and grow your own
                    peppermint at home.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Prepare your stem cutting. To start propagating your new plants, cut a
                        five to six inch piece of peppermint from a plant that is already
                        established. Remove the leaves from the bottom two inches of the piece.
                        Place your stems in a glass of water that is placed in the full sun.
                        When it has new roots that are a couple inches long, it is ready to
                        plant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose your container. Many people choose to grow peppermint in a container
                        because it can easily take over a garden bed. Go with a plastic container
                        to keep the soil moist, because peppermint thrives in consistently-moist
                        soil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fill your container with soil. Fill your container with moist potting
                        soil. If you are growing your peppermint indoors, do not use manure or
                        emulsion. A layer of mulch can help the soil retain moisture. Place
                        your container in a location that gets full sunlight.
                    </li>
                    <li>Plant your peppermint stems. Carefully plant each cutting in the moist
                        soil, spacing the stems at least 10 inches apart.
                    </li>
                    <li>Regularly water your peppermint. Unlike other plants, you should not allow
                        peppermint soil to dry out between waterings. The soil should always be
                        moist. Water your peppermint everyday or every other day.
                    </li>
                    <li>Harvest your peppermint. When your peppermint leaves are fragrant, they
                        are ready to harvest. For small harvests, simply pinch or snip off the
                        fresh leaves or sprigs you would like to remove. For larger harvests, cut
                        the entire plant down to just above the first set of leaves. This removes
                        the lower leaves, which may have already begun to yellow, and helps the plant
                        grow bushier for the second or third harvest.

                <h3>Care Tips for growing Peppermint:</h3>
                <p>
                    Peppermint is a hardy plant, but it still requires attention and care.
                    Here are some tips for growing your peppermint:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prune your peppermint regularly. Peppermint is a wild grower that you will need
                        to prune to make sure your leaves are flavorful and to ensure healthy new growth.
                        Prune the top half of your plant back before and during its growing season in late
                        spring to mid-summer. Keep an eye out for stems that appear 'woody' or dry and
                        remove them. Cut back and replace your peppermint plants every two to three years.
                        You may also remove flower buds to keep the leaves at peak oil concentration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Give your plant enough light. As long as the soil is moist, peppermint prefers
                        exposure to full sun which helps the plant produce its oils. They can tolerate
                        partial shade, but the flavor is strongest when your plant receives full sun.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep the soil moist. Peppermint is not as susceptible to root rot as many other
                        plants, and it thrives in moist soil. Make sure that this thirsty plant gets
                        enough water.
                    </li>
                    <li>Monitor your plant for pests. Mint plants usually repel pests like deer and
                        rodents, smaller insects such as aphids and spider mites. Spray your plants
                        with a hose to knock them off your plant.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>When to Harvest Peppermint:</h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on the health of your plant, peppermint can be harvested two to three
                    times per growing season. The ideal time to harvest is right before your plant
                    begins to bloom. This is when the oil concentration in the leaves is its highest.
