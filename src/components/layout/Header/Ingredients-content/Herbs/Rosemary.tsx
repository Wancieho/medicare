                    <h2>What is Rosemary?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rosemary is an aromatic evergreen shrub with leaves similar to hemlock
                        needles. It is native to the Mediterranean region, but is reasonably
                        hardy in cool climates. Special cultivars like 'Arp' can withstand winter
                        temperatures down to about -20 degrees Celcius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).
                        It can withstand droughts, surviving a severe lack of water for lengthy
                        periods. In some parts of the world, it is considered a potentially
                        invasive species. The seeds are often difficult to start, with a low
                        germination rate and relatively slow growth, but the plant can live
                        as long as 30 years.

                        Popularly known for being a culinary herb, rosemary is from the
                        mint family and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries.
                        Rosemary essential oil has a woodsy fragrance and is considered a
                        mainstay in aromatherapy. However, rosemary oil has a wide range of
                        uses, from treating ailments and pains to promoting hair growth,

                                    Rosemary oil can be used to relieve a variety of gastrointestinal complaints,
                                    including indigestion, gas, stomach cramping, bloating and constipation. It
                                    also stimulates appetite and helps regulate the creation of bile, which plays
                                    a crucial role in digestion.

                                    To treat stomach ailments, combine 1 teaspoon of
                                    a carrier oil such as coconut or almond oil with 5 drops of rosemary oil and
                                    gently massage the mixture over your abdomen. Applying rosemary oil in this
                                    way on a regular basis detoxifies the liver and promotes gallbladder health.

                                    Research shows that simply inhaling the aroma of rosemary essential oil can
                                    lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in your blood. High cortisol
                                    levels are caused by stress, anxiety or any thought or event that puts your
                                    body in "fight-or-flight" mode.

                                    When stress is chronic, cortisol can cause
                                    weight gain, oxidative stress, high blood pressure and heart disease. You
                                    can combat stress instantly using an essential oil diffuser or even by
                                    inhaling over an open bottle.

                                    to any moisturizer. Simply add a few drops to facial moisturizer to use
                                    rosemary oil every day and get a healthy glow. To treat problem areas,
                                    dilute 5 drops of rosemary oil in 1 teaspoon of a carrier oil and apply
                                    it to the site. It won't make your skin more oily; in fact, it removes
                                    excess oil from the surface of your skin.

                                    Several studies suggest that rosemary extract may inhibit tumor growth by
                                    preventing cancerous cells from replicating. One study found that rosemary,
                                    on its own and in combination with curcumin, helped prevent breast cancer.
                                    A second study found similar effects of rosemary on colon cancer cells.

                        The use of herbs is a time-honored approach to strengthening the
                        body and treating disease. However, herbs can trigger side effects
                        and interact with other herbs, supplements, or medications. For these
                        reasons, you should take herbs with care, under the supervision of a
                        health care provider.

                                Rosemary is generally considered safe when taken in recommended doses.
                                However, there have been occasional reports of allergic reactions.
                                Because of their volatile oil content, large quantities of rosemary
                                leaves can cause serious side effects, including: vomiting, spasms,
                                coma and in some cases, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because higher doses of rosemary may cause miscarriage, pregnant and
                                nursing women should not take rosemary as a supplement. But it is safe
                                to eat as a spice in food. People with high blood pressure, ulcers,
                                Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis should not take rosemary.
                                Rosemary oil can be toxic if ingested and should <span className="em-span">
                                    never</span>be taken orally.

                        Various rosemary preparations have been used for various indications; however,
                        clinical evidence is lacking to provide dosing recommendations for any indication.
                        Traditional uses include 2 g of chopped leaf infused in water, or 2 to 4 g of the
                        shoot.

                    <h2>How do I grow Rosemary at Home in my gargen?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rosemary is a woody-stemmed plant with needle-like leaves that can
                        commonly reach 3 feet in height, eventually stretching to 5 feet in
                        warmer climates unless clipped. In zone 8 and farther south, rosemary
                        bushes make a good evergreen hedge. In zone 7 and colder, try growing
                        rosemary in a container you can bring inside in cold weather. You can
                        even train rosemary into topiary shapes. Plants are tolerant of salt
                        spray, making them a good choice for pots on the beach.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="content-section2">
                <p>
                    With the right soil and water conditions, rosemary can grow into a large
                    evergreen hedge in warm areas. Placed along a path or border, it wafts a
                    soothing minty aroma to those who pass by.
                    Plant rosemary in spring once all chances of frost have passed. This
                    delightful herb is an all-star in the kitchen and is a great option for
                    raised garden beds, containers, and in-ground gardens.
                    Space rosemary plants 2 to 3 feet apart in an area with abundant sunlight
                    and rich, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Before planting, set your garden up for success by mixing in several
                    inches of aged compost or other rich organic matter into your native soil.
                    For container growing, consider a premium bagged potting mix.
                    Promote spectacular growth by feeding rosemary regularly with a water-soluble
                    plant food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to water regularly but be sure to let the soil
                    dry out between waterings. Harvest rosemary stems by snipping them with
                    sharp gardening shears. Harvest often once the plant is established, but
                    avoid pruning more than one-third of the plant at a time.

                </p>
                <h3>Soil, Planting, and Care:</h3>
                <p>
                    Set out rosemary in spring, planting starter plants 2 to 3 feet apart; you can
                    also plant in fall in zone 8 and south. Choose strong, vigorous Bonnie Plants
                    rosemary to get your garden off to a great start—after all, Bonnie has spent
                    over a century helping home gardeners successfully grow their own food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plants are slow growing at first, but pick up speed in their second year.
                    Rosemary prefers full sun and light, well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 7.
                    Improve your existing soil by adding a few inches of aged compost-enriched
                    Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics All Purpose In-Ground Soil and mixing it in
                    with the top layer. Potted rosemary needs a lighter-weight soil mix, so fill
                    containers with Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® All Purpose Container Mix instead.
                    Keep the soil uniformly moist, allowing it to dry out between waterings. Mulch
                    your plants to keep roots moist in summer and insulated in winter, but take care
                    to keep mulch away from the crown of the plant. In the spring, prune dead wood out
                    of the plants.
                    For best growth, it's not enough just to start with rich, nutritious soil. You'll
                    also want to feed rosemary regularly throughout the season with a plant food that
                    feeds both your plants and the soil, like Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® Edibles
                    Plant Nutrition (following the directions on the label).
                </p>
                <h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
                <p>
                    Whiteflies, spider mites, scale, and mealybugs can all bother rosemary, as can powdery mildew and root rot, particularly in humid regions. To prevent mildew and rot, be sure your plants enjoy good drainage and air circulation. In zone 7 and northward, extreme cold will kill the tops of the rosemary plant. In areas where it is likely to be hurt by winter, plant in a protected spot such as one near a south-facing masonry wall and away from the prevailing winter wind; also mulch to protect the roots. In zone 8 and farther south, rosemary needs no winter protection.
                    Harvest and Storage
                    Cut stems at any time for fresh rosemary. To dry rosemary, use a rack or hang it upside down in bunches to dry. Once stems are dry, strip the leaves from them. You can also freeze rosemary sprigs, preserve them in vinegar, or use them to flavour oil or butter.
