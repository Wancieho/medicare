                    <p>
                        Ginger root or ginger, is widely used as a spice and a folk medicine.
                        It is a herbaceous perennial which grows annual pseudostems (false stems
                        made of the rolled bases of leaves) about one meter tall, bearing narrow
                        leaf blades. The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals
                        with purple edges, and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots.

                    Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (Curcuma
                    longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal. Ginger originated
                    in Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the
                    Austronesian peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific
                    during the Austronesian expansion (c.5,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, arriving
                    in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans.
                    The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild
                    ginger because of their similar taste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Used in traditional medicine in China, India and Japan for centuries, and
                    as a dietary supplement, research shows that ginger may be helpful for
                    mild nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy, although its safety
                    has not been demonstrated. It remains uncertain whether ginger is effective
                    for treating any disease, and use of ginger as a drug has not been approved
                    by the FDA.

                <p>
                    In 2020, world production of ginger was 4.3 million tonnes, led by India
                    with 43% of the world total.

                    <p>
                        Ginger, the "root" or the rhizome, of the plant Zingiber officinale,
                        has been a popular spice and herbal medicine for thousands of years.
                        It has a long history of use in Asian, Indian, and Arabic herbal traditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In China, for example, ginger has been used to help digestion and treat
                        stomach upset, diarrhea, and nausea for more than 2000 years. Ginger has
                        also been used to help treat arthritis, colic, diarrhea, and heart conditions.
                        It has been used to help treat the common cold, flu-like symptoms, headaches,
                        and painful menstrual periods.

                    <p>
                        Ginger is native to Asia where it has been used as a cooking spice for at
                        least 4,400 years.

                <h3>Fights germs:</h3>
                <p>
                    Certain chemical compounds in fresh ginger help your body ward off germs. They are
                    especially good at halting growth of bacteria like E.coli and shigella, and they
                    may also keep viruses like RSV at bay.
                </p>
                <h3>Keeps your mouth Healthy:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginger's antibacterial power may also brighten your smile. Active compounds in
                    ginger called gingerols keep oral bacteria from growing. These bacteria are the
                    same ones that can cause periodontal disease, a serious gum infection.
                </p>
                <h3>Calms nausea:</h3>
                <p>
                    The old wives' tale may be true: Ginger helps if you are trying to ease a
                    queasy stomach, especially during pregnancy. It may work by breaking up
                    and getting rid of built-up gas in your intestines. It might also help
                    settle seasickness or nausea caused by chemotherapy.
                </p>
                <h3>Soothes sore muscles:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginger will not whisk away muscle pain on the spot, but it may tame soreness
                    over time. In some studies, people with muscle aches from exercise who
                    took ginger had less pain the next day than those who did not.
                </p>
                <h3>Ease Arthiritis symptoms:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginger is an anti-inflammatory, which means it reduces swelling. That may be
                    especially helpful for treating symptoms of both rheumatoid arthritis and
                    osteoarthritis. You might get relief from pain and swelling either by taking
                    ginger by mouth or by using a ginger compress or patch on your skin.
                </p>
                <h3>Curbs cancer growth-Related:</h3>
                <p>
                    Some studies show that bioactive molecules in ginger may slow down the
                    growth of some cancers like colorectal, gastric, ovarian, liver, skin,
                    breast, and prostate cancer. But much more research is needed to see
                    if this is true.
                </p>
                <h3>Lowers blood sugar:</h3>
                <p>
                    One recent small study suggested that ginger may help your body use insulin
                    better. Larger studies are needed to see if ginger could help improve blood
                    sugar levels.
                </p>
                <h3>Eases period pains:</h3>
                <p>
                    Got menstrual cramps? Ginger powder may help. In studies, women who took
                    1500 milligrams of ginger powder once a day for 3 days during their cycle
                    felt less pain than women who did not.
                </p>
                <h3>Lowers Cholesterol:</h3>
                <p>
                    A daily dose of ginger may help you battle your bad or LDL cholesterol
                    levels. In a recent study, taking 5 grams of ginger a day for 3 months
                    lowered people's LDL cholesterol an average of 30 points.
                </p>
                <h3>Protects against disease:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginger is loaded with antioxidants, compounds that prevent stress and damage
                    to your body's DNA. They may help your body fight off chronic diseases like
                    high blood pressure, heart disease, and diseases of the lungs, plus promote
                    healthy aging.
                </p>
                <h3>Relieves Indegestion-Related:</h3>
                <p>
                    If you live with chronic indigestion, also called dyspepsia, ginger could
                    bring some relief. Ginger before meals may make your system empty faster,
                    leaving less time for food to sit and cause problems.

                        to have side effects from ginger. In high doses it may cause

                    <p>
                        Because ginger is a tropical plant, it will not live year-round in colder
                        climates. But that does not mean you cannot grow it at home. Plant it
                        during the beginning of spring (whenever you're sure there will not be
                        frost), or keep it potted indoors when temperatures are below 50 degrees
                        Fahrenheit.

                    Growing ginger is pretty simple. Like potatoes, you can start a new ginger plant
                    from a healthy root you buy at the produce market. Look for one that's about 3 to
                    5 inches and has some buds growing on it. Soak the root in water for a few hours
                    before planting to encourage growth.
                </p>
                <p>Follow these steps, too:</p>

                            15 inches wide).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fill the pot with healthy soil, something full of compost that lets
                            water in and out.
                        </li>
                        <li>Plant the root (buds facing up) 1 inch under the soil.</li>
