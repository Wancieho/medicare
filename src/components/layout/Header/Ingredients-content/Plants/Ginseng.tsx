                    <h2>What is Ginseng?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ginseng is a name you have probably heard being thrown around,
                        especially in relation to natural healthcare products and supplements.
                        But there are actually many different species of ginseng, found all
                        over the world. There is Panax ginseng(Korean
                        ginseng), which is present in Asia. Then Panax quinquefolius(American
                        ginseng) as it is found naturally in Canada and the  USA.
                        Another is Panax japonicus(Japanese ginseng).
                        Panax ginseng originated in Asia, and today it is grown in the cold
                        temperate regions in North East China and Korean peninsula. It was
                        first recorded in Chinese medicine over 2000 years ago, and is
                        now one of the most heavily cultivated herbs in the world.

                    Panax ginseng is a perennial shrub, about 50-80cm in height. It
                    bears inconspicuous flowers which develop into red berries, and has
                    a turnip-shaped root that quite often, due to the way it branches,
                    appears like a human figure. Panax Ginseng  is a species of plant
                    whose root is the original source of ginseng. It is a perennial
                    plant that grows in the mountains of East Asia.

                    <p>
                        Ginseng is an herb that is rich in antioxidants. It may offer benefits
                        for brain health, immune function, blood sugar control, and more.
                        Ginseng has also been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries.

                <h2>Health benefits include:</h2>
                <h3>Contains antioxidants that reduces inflammation:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginseng has beneficial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
                    Some test-tube studies have shown that ginseng extracts and ginsenoside c
                    ompounds could inhibit inflammation and reduce oxidative damage to cells,
                    which can contribute to chronic disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results are promising in humans, as well.
                    One study in 12 active males found that short-term supplementation with
                    American ginseng extract reduced exercise-induced muscle damage and decreased
                    markers of inflammation compared to a placebo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A larger study in 2014 followed 71 postmenopausal females who took 3 grams(g)
                    of red ginseng or a placebo daily for 12 weeks. Antioxidant activity and
                    oxidative stress markers were then measured. red ginseng may help reduce
                    oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities.
                </p>
                <h3>May benefit brain function:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginseng could help improve brain functions like memory, behavior, and mood.
                    Some test-tube and animal studies show that components in ginseng, like
                    ginsenosides and compound K, could protect the brain against damage caused
                    by free radicals.

                    Interestingly, one study in 6,422 older adults found that regular
                    consumption of ginseng for at least 5 years was associated with improved
                    cognitive function later in life.

                    Another small study showed that taking 200 milligrams (mg) of American
                    ginseng significantly improved working memory after 3 hours, compared to a
                    placebo.

                    According to one review, ginseng could also help ease stress and may
                    offer benefits for depression and anxiety.
                </p>
                <h3>Could improve erectile dysfunction:</h3>
                <p>
                    Some research suggests that ginseng may be a useful alternative for the
                    treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED).

                    According to some older research, certain compounds found in ginseng may
                    protect against oxidative stress in the blood vessels and tissues of the
                    penis to help restore normal function.

                    Additionally, studies have shown that ginseng may promote the production
                    of nitric oxide, a compound that improves muscle relaxation in the male
                    genitals and increases blood circulation.

                    Still, research on the effects of ginseng on ED has turned up mixed
                    results and more high quality studies are needed.

                    In fact, one review of nine studies found that ginseng could improve
                    self-reported ability to have intercourse in males.
                </p>
                <h3>May boost the immune system:</h3>
                <p>
                    According to one review, ginseng possesses potent anti-bacterial,
                    anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties and may enhance the function of
                    the immune system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, one animal study found that black red ginseng extract
                    increased the number of immune cells and enhanced antioxidant levels
                    in the liver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, another study in 100 people showed that taking 2 g of Korean
                    red ginseng per day for 8 weeks significantly increased levels of
                    immune cells compared to a placebo.
                </p>
                <h3>May have potential benefits against cancer:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginseng may be helpful in reducing the risk of certain cancers.
                    Ginsenosides in this herb have been shown to help reduce inflammation and
                    provide antioxidant protection.

                    The cell cycle is the process by which cells normally grow and divide.
                    Ginsenosides could benefit this cycle by preventing abnormal cell
                    production and growth.

                    A review of several studies concluded that people who take ginseng may
                    have a a 16% lower risk of developing cancer. Ginseng may also help
                    improve the health of people undergoing chemotherapy and could reduce
                    side effects and enhance the effect of some cancer treatments
                </p>
                <h3>May fight tiredness and increase energy levels:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginseng has been shown to help ease fatigue and increase energy levels.

                    Various animal studies have linked some components in ginseng, like
                    polysaccharides and oligopeptides, with lower oxidative stress and higher
                    energy production in cells, which could help decrease fatigue.

                    One review of 10 studies concluded that ginseng could significantly
                    improve symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome compared to a placebo,
                    even after just 15 days.

                    Another review showed that taking American or Asian ginseng could
                    decrease symptoms of cancer-related fatigue when taken in doses of
                    2,000 mg or 3,000 mg per day, respectively.
                </p>
                <h3>Could lower blood sugar:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginseng seems to be beneficial in the control of blood sugar levels
                    in people both with and without diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    American and Asian ginseng have been shown to improve pancreatic
                    cell function, boost insulin production, and enhance the uptake of
                    blood sugar in tissues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, studies show that ginseng extracts help by providing
                    antioxidant protection that can help reduce free radicals in the
                    cells of those with diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One review of eight studies found that ginseng supplementation
                    could decrease fasting blood sugar levels and improve insulin
                    sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another 8-week study showed that taking 3 g per day of American ginseng
                    significantly reduced fasting blood sugar levels and improved hemoglobin
                    A1c, a marker of long-term blood sugar control, compared to a placebo in
                    people with type 2 diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seems that fermented red ginseng could be even more effective at
                    blood sugar control. Fermented ginseng is produced with the help of live
                    bacteria that transform the ginsenosides into a more easily absorbed and
                    potent form.

                <h3>How to plant Ginseng:</h3>
                <p>
                    To prepare your site, remove low branches of trees to promote air movement
                    and be sure your soil has plenty of incorporated organic matter. Well-composted
                    leaf litter is an excellent addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ginseng can be grown from seed or seedling. Purchase good quality seed that
                    has been stratified (gone through a cold period) for fastest germination,
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is an advantage to starting with ginseng seedlings instead of seeds
                    which are more widely available these days and may be planted in spring or
                    fall. One or two year old seedlings will speed up the time to maturity, when
                    the root is large enough to harvest, which is a minimum of five years old.
                </p>
                <h3>Can I grow Ginseng in a container?</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginseng may be grown in a container, especially in its early years and as
                    seedlings. Select a container that has a drainage hole. Use a loamy soil
                    mix and plant your seeds about one-and-a-half inches deep. Site the
                    container in a shady spot, keep it watered, and leave it outdoors in
                    winter. Bury [the container] a few inches into the ground and mulch to
                    mimic a wild plant going through a cold period mulched with litter from the
                    fall of autumn leaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ginseng is not a good choice for growing indoors. It prefers a well-drained
                    forest soil, good air flow, and needs to go through the cycles of the seasons
                    including cold dormancies, where the leaves and stem of the plant die back
                    to the ground in the fall, to reemerge in the spring.
                </p>
                <h3>Harvesting Ginseng:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ginseng is a slow grower, even in the best of conditions. Ginseng plants
                    may grow for decades and can be aged by counting the neck scars left on the
                    top of the root from each growing season's stem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will likely be 5-10 years before you can harvest a decent root. Roots should
                    be dug in the fall as the leaves begin to die. Gently wash off your harvested
                    roots, then place them on a screen to dry in a well-ventilated area out of
                    direct sunlight. Rotate them occasionally so they dry evenly. Drying usually
                    takes two to four weeks, although large roots may take longer. Store your roots
                    in a ventilated box or basket.
                </p>
                <h3>Why is there a red and white Ginseng?</h3>
                <p>
                    The difference in colour comes down to how ginseng is treated. White ginseng
                    is naturally dried in the sun. Red ginseng is steam heated between 100-110
                    degrees for 2-3 hours. This treatment kills any potential pathogens on the
                    plant's roots. The downside is that it degrades some of the active components
                    which are found in the outer layers of bark.
