                    <p>
                        Flax, also known as common flax or linseed, is a flowering plant,
                        Linum usitatissimum, in the family Linaceae. It is cultivated as a
                        food and fiber crop in regions of the world with temperate climates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flaxseed is a plant-based food that provides healthful fat,
                        antioxidants, and fiber. It can provide many health benefits.
                        People grew flax as a crop in ancient Egypt and China. In Asia,
                        it has had a role in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years.

                    The nutrients in flaxseed include lignans, antioxidants, fiber, protein,

                    <p>
                        Like other plant-based foods, flaxseed is rich in antioxidants. These
                        can help prevent disease by removing molecules called free radicals
                        from the body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Free radicals occur as a result of natural processes and environmental
                        pressures. If there are too many free radicals in the body, oxidative
                        stress can develop, leading to cell damage and disease. Antioxidants
                        help remove free radicals from the body.

                <h2>The health benefits of using Flax Seeds:</h2>
                <h3>Reducing the risk of cancer:</h3>
                <p>
                    Flaxseed contains omega-3 fatty acids. Research suggests that these
                    may help prevent different types of cancer cells from growing.
                    Flaxseed also contains lignans, which are antioxidants that may slow
                    tumor growth by preventing them from forming new blood vessels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-013-0155-7">
                        2013</a> survey found a lower incidence of breast cancer among
                    females who consumed flaxseed regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, in 2018, the
                    authors of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5808339/">
                        review</a> concluded that flaxseed may help
                    reduce the risk of breast cancer after menopause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lignans are a type of phytoestrogen, which is a plant-based nutrient that
                    acts in a similar way to estrogen. There has been some concern that
                    phytoestrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, but recent research
                    suggests that they may play a protective role.
                </p>
                <h3>Improving cholesterol and heart health:</h3>
                <p>
                    The American Heart Association (AHA) recommend eating more fiber and omega-3s
                    to boost heart health. Lignans, too, may help prevent cardiovascular disease.
                    Flaxseed contains all of these nutrients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flaxseed also contains phytosterols. Phytosterols have a similar structure
                    to cholesterol, but they help prevent the absorption of cholesterol in the
                    intestines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consuming phytosterols may therefore help reduce levels of low-density
                    lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad,” cholesterol in the body.
                    In 2010, researchers looked at the effect of flaxseed on the cholesterol
                    levels of males with moderately high cholesterol. Participants took either
                    a 20 milligram (mg) capsule containing lignans, a 100 mg capsule, or a
                    placebo for 12 weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cholesterol levels fell after taking lignans, especially in those who took
                    the 100 mg capsules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The researchers behind a 2012 study involving 17 people found that consuming
                    flaxseed lowered LDL cholesterol levels and helped the body remove fat,
                    although they note that the overall diet may also play a role. The team
                    suggested that dietary flaxseed may be useful for lowering cholesterol
                    levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some scientists have also linked omega-3 oils, which are usually present
                    in oily fish, to reductions in cardiovascular risk. Researchers have
                    suggested that flaxseed could offer an alternative to marine sources
                    of omega 3. This could make it a useful resource for people who follow
                    a plant-based diet.

                <h3>Easing the symptoms of Arthiritis:</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the Arthritis Foundation, flaxseed may help reduce joint
                    pain and stiffness. Some people take it for rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,
                    and Raynaud's phenomenon.

                    They add that there is a lack of evidence to support its use for this
                    purpose, but they say that the ALA in flaxseed may help reduce
                    inflammation. People can take it:

                    You can avoid these side effects by moderately consuming flaxseeds.
                    It is most often an excessive intake that causes these digestive
                    issues. Also, ensure that you drink plenty of water throughout the
                    day when you have eaten flaxseeds. This will keep problems, such as
                    constipation, away.

                <p>
                    Raw and unripe flaxseeds may contain toxic compounds. Hence, avoid
                    using them. Pregnant women should avoid flaxseeds, even flaxseed
                    oil or their supplements, due to the mild estrogenic (hormonal) effects.
                    It is rare for someone to develop allergic reactions to flaxseeds.

                        Growing Flax Seeds on a commercial level
                        can be a complicated process, but planting flax from seed in your
                        garden is easier than you may think. In fact, you have likely grown
                        its wildflower cousins, blue flax and scarlet flax before, or know
                        someone who has. Common flax, like its cousins, is a cool-season
                        plant, and the seeds should be planted as soon as the ground can
                        be worked in spring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A late frost will not usually harm the plants
                        once they emerge, as seedlings with at least two leaves can tolerate
                        temperatures as low as 28 F. (-2 C.). Look for a sunny, sheltered
                        planting site when planting flax from seed. Although flax will
                        adapt to most well-drained soil types, rich soil is optimum.
                        Dig in a generous amount of compost, manure, or other organic
                        matter, especially if your soil is poor.
